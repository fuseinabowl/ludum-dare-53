# Track building

- Only allow connecting "roots" of different types. Currently villages can be connected to villages and farms can be connected to farms.
- Bridges
- Only allow tracks to be built between non-sharp edges of a polygon

# Level building

- Single large level
- People are unlikely to replay our LD game, minimal bang for buck implementing proc gen

# Train moving

- Smoothing at ends aka accelleration
- Carriages
- Flipping direction of carriages at ends

# Economy

- Replace with simpler system
- You need to connect a number of sources to destinations to unlock another source
  - all hard coded as part of our level
- You have unlimited tracks
- You have unlimited bridges (if we have bridges)
- You are just trying to work out the puzzle of laying the tracks along the weird grid

# Gameify it

- Lots of scope creep
- Focus on the puzzle element of laying the tracks and on the zen element
- No additional game elements

# Glue

- Tutorial flow like prompts (may want other things like a tutorial fog)
- HUD
- Menus

  - Day/night cycle
  - Weather cycle

# Graphics
