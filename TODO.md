# Track building

- Only allow connecting "roots" of different types. Currently villages can be connected to villages and farms can be connected to farms.
- Bridges

# Level building

- I think random world would be really really really nice to add some variety. we have the ability to generate these interesting tiled levels
- Can have a difficulty mode which generates more obstacles.
- Use FairRandom to generate a distribution of obstacles (houses, unpassable terrain) and villages and stuff
- Rivers? (hard to randomly generate, but would provide a difficulty spike)
- Multiple tiers of farms
- Quarries?

# Train moving

- Smoothing at ends aka accelleration

# Economy

- Get money when train arrives
- Get stone when train from quarry arrives
- Placing tracks costs money
- Placing bridges costs stone + money
- Upgradeable trains - speed, larger loads

# Gameify it

- Village happiness meter
- Village population increases but needs more food
- Efficiency meter
- Parts of map are gated on having bridges

# Glue

- Tutorial flow like prompts (may want other things like a tutorial fog)
- HUD
- Menus

# Fun stuff

- Day/night cycle
- Weather cycle

# Graphics

- Models, animations
- particles
- terrain textures
- transitions

# Sound

- Music
- Effects
