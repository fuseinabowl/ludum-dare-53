# MUST

- Preview track deletion
- Preview track addition
- Fix track split and rejoin bug
- Obstacles
- Reward feedback for completing a road
- SFX. Critical:
    - Track placed and deleted
    - Track completed
    - Delivery "buy"
    - Delivery "sell"
    - Train chugging
- Level design. Critical:
    - Decide on final layout: grid size and layouts
    - 10 routes
- UI canvas shows the number of tracks completed
- SOME kind of "win" feedback. it can be anything! Just a popup that says "congrats :-)" and then a "keep playing" button
- Music. Critical:
    - A loop
- Ambience. Critical:
    - Birds. Wind. Anything. I have all of these sounds already do just need to grab them.
- Camera. Critical:
    - make it faster, constants better... needs tuning based on the level size.
- Modeling. Critical:
    - train
    - 2 station types, can tell them apart somehow
- Graphicsy stuff. Critical:
    - make it not look so flat

### MAYBE

- SOME kind of tutorial thing
- Saw an adjacent edge bug where it wasn't generating until later. adjacent stations
- Smooth train movement
- SFX non-critical:
    - Train movement
- Ambience non-critical:
    - Town ambience when zoomed in
- Camera
    - mouse controls
    - zoom affects the x angle
- Level design. Non-critical:
    - As many routes as possible!!
- Modeling. non-critical:
    - nice little model placement around villages and farms
- Graphicsy stuff. non-critical:
    - placement arrow moves a teeny tiny bit (bounces) - not distraction, but obvious that it can be interacted with
    - train smoke or other particles
    - Track placement animation.
    - lighting
    - make tiles not all completely flat, so that the lighting bounces off them a bit differently??? somehow.
    - more particles, baby
